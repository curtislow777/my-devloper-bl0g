        <p>
        wow welcome back to my blog
        this week we learnt about
        how to create a form with radio, checkbox and inputs.
        nested, descendent elements 
        !important means important it will override everything because its important so it should only be used in important situations!
        to mobile friendly :-) through the media query and html inspector
        position tags, (relative, absolute, fixed)
        z-index (works only on elements with position tags)
        flexbox
        flex-direction
        flex-wrap
        flex-flow
        justify-content
        align-content
        wireframes, fidelity XD
        
        thx for reading

            this week we learnt how to create,
            responsive images to automatically resize based on the screensize or column layouts (desktop/mobile)
            using background-size: cover,
            flex-grow, flex-basis, 
            
            and also wireframes to get started on the assignment
